### ğŸ‡§ğŸ‡· JoÃ£o Vitor Passos

Just a Christian software developer and Computer Science undergraduate who loves Jesus, coding and solving problems. Low-level programming, memory management, databases and other CS fields are among my interest and I keep learning more every day.

Currently working on Rust side projects and going in-depth on data structures, databases and operating systems.
